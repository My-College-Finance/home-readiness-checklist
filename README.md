## Features

*   **Multi-Stage Assessment:** Guides users through four key stages:
    1.  **Readiness Checklist:** Evaluates income stability, credit health, savings (down payment, closing costs, emergency fund), cost understanding, and awareness of homebuyer programs. Calculates a readiness score. Includes a live DTI calculation.
    2.  **Affordability Calculator:** Estimates potential mortgage payments (PITI), calculates the resulting back-end DTI based on user inputs (income, debts, home price, rate, etc.), and visualizes the monthly payment breakdown and loan amortization using Chart.js.
    3.  **Loan Type Quiz:** Suggests potentially suitable mortgage types (Conventional, FHA, VA, USDA) based on credit score range, military status, property location, down payment, and need for assistance.
    4.  **Summary Report:** Consolidates the readiness score, affordability analysis, loan recommendation, and provides dynamically generated, actionable next steps.
*   **Informative Tooltips:** Help icons (â“˜) provide context and definitions for each input field and question.
*   **FAQ & Glossary Panels:** Slide-out side panels offer frequently asked questions and definitions of common mortgage/real estate terms, with search functionality.
*   **Theme Toggle:** Switch between Light and Dark modes for user comfort.
*   **PDF Export (Summary Only):** Download a clean, print-friendly PDF report containing *only* the final Summary page (Stage 4) using the browser's native print-to-PDF functionality. Input fields, buttons, and charts are excluded from the print view.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bar and active step indicators show users where they are in the process.
*   **Local State Saving:** User progress and inputs are automatically saved in the browser's `localStorage` for convenience. Includes a manual save button.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts for optimal use on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
